# numericalrecipes

Numerical Recipes as shown by William H. Press, Samuel A. Teukolsky's et al. "Numerical Recipes in FORTRAN 90".

There is a <a href="https://sciold.ui.ac.ir/~sjalali/nrf/"> website </a>  where anyone can download the source code scripts of all the subroutines contained in the oldest 2 volumes of the book, in FORTRAN 77. Also be sure to give it a look.

I also include this <a href="https://icl.utk.edu/~mgates3/docs/fortran.html"> super useful reference about Fortran 90/95 </a>.
